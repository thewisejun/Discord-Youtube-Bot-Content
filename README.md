How To Promote:![serverconfig](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64604222/135788613-84d30960-59c1-472d-98c0-57323bc508bc.PNG)


➼  Go to content-promotion. React to 5 videos that have been promoted there after you watch at least 60%, like and comment something nice on the video. 

➼  To show you have done this you can send screenshot proof in send-proof. Make sure you show the title, likes, amount you've watched of each video, and 
your comment in each screenshot.

➼ Type !top in bot-commands and look at leaderboard to see how many points you have - you gain 1 point per video you react to and need 5 points to promote.

➼ If you have 5 points, type !post {video link} {Length} {Platform} into bot-commands and your video will appear in content-promotion for other people to react to!

➼ If the video is over 15 minutes long, you only have to watch 60% of 15 minutes, not 60% of the whole video. This means that the maximum you must watch of any video is 9 minutes!

➼ If you promote your twitch then please replace {Length} with 
"Stream"

➼ If you're supporting a stream then please take two screenshots, one when you start watching and one 15 minutes later. Your second screenshot must include some sort of contribution to the chat about the stream or a general conversation with the host. If there is no live chat please watch 20 minutes instead. We understand that 15 minutes is a while but streams can be any length and small streamers do not get a lot of interaction from the same person for a long period of time. You will also gain 2 points rather than one as long as you ping @Moderator when you send proof to remind us to give you the extra point!

➼ If you're supporting a Social Media post, like the post and comment, showing proof for this in send-proof.

➼ If you're posting a Social Media Post, just replace <length> with "Post"

__Key Commands:__

!top

!post

!help

Reminders

➼ Don't react to your own videos in content-promotion.

➼ Do not use a capital when using the commands - it will not work.

➼ You are only allowed to post 1 video per day. This does not mean every 24hrs - it means after midnight. Please be reasonable with the spacing of your ads. This means you're not allowed to post at 23:59 and then 00:01 (Use common sense)

➼ If you do not sent proof that you have watched and liked the video, you will be warned in audit-room and further action will be taken if you do not comply with what we ask.

➼ If we think you've unliked the video, because we see one or more less likes on the video than you showed in your proof, you will have to send another screenshot to show that it wasn't you. If you do unlike, you will be warned and your points and/or ad will be removed. If you remove your comment or say something nasty your points and/or ad will be removed

➼ If you would like us to keep track of likes please post proof in before-posting of how many likes your video had prior to you promoting it

➼ In order to access promote permissions, please assign yourself roles in self-roles and please read before giving yourself any of these roles

➼ If you, for some reason, are not able to send images into send-proof, please:
1. Attempt to DM your proof to a moderator
2. Ping a moderator in audit-room to let us know
Do not just leave it otherwise it will be counted as breaking a rule

Please head to rules and then verify
